# Sort Ordering:
# Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered. Precedence MUST be calculated by
# separating the version into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure into precedence).
# Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows:
# 1. Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1.
# 2. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version.
#    Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0.
# 3. Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by
#    comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a difference is found as follows:
#    3.a. identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically and identifiers with letters or hyphens are
#         compared lexically in ASCII sort order.
#    3.b. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers.
#    3.c. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.
#    Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.

=head1 Name

SemVer - Use semantic version numbers

=head1 Synopsis

  use SemVer; our $VERSION = SemVer->new('1.2.0-b1');

=head1 Description

This module subclasses L<version> to create semantic versions, as defined by
the L<Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Specification|http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>.
The three salient points of the specification, for the purposes of version
formatting, are:

=over

=item 1.

A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative 
integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the 
minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. 
For instance: C<< 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0 >>.

=item 2.

A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot 
separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST 
comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen C<[0-9A-Za-z-]>. Identifiers MUST NOT 
be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions 
have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version 
indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended 
compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version: 
C<< 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92 >>

=item 3.

Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated 
identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST 
comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen C<[0-9A-Za-z-]>. Identifiers MUST NOT 
be empty. Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus 
two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. 
Examples: C<< 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85 >>.

=head2 Usage

For strict parsing of semantic version numbers, use the C<new()> constructor.
If you need something more flexible, use C<declare()>. And if you need
something more comparable with what L<version> expects, try C<parse()>.
Compare how these constructors deal with various version strings (with values
shown as returned by C<normal()>:

    Argument  | new      | declare     | parse
 -------------+----------+---------------------------
  '1.0.0'     | 1.0.0    | 1.0.0       | 1.0.0
  '5.5.2-b1'  | 5.5.2-b1 | 5.5.2-b1    | 5.5.2-b1
  '1.05.0'    | <error>  | 1.5.0       | 1.5.0
  '1.0'       | <error>  | 1.0.0       | 1.0.0
  '  012.2.2' | <error>  | 12.2.2      | 12.2.2
  '1.1'       | <error>  | 1.1.0       | 1.100.0
   1.1        | <error>  | 1.1.0       | 1.100.0
  '1.1.0b1'   | <error>  | 1.1.0-b1    | 1.1.0-b1
  '1.1-b1'    | <error>  | 1.1.0-b1    | 1.100.0-b1
  '1.2.b1'    | <error>  | 1.2.0-b1    | 1.2.0-b1
  '9.0-beta4' | <error>  | 9.0.0-beta4 | 9.0.0-beta4
  '9'         | <error>  | 9.0.0       | 9.0.0
  '1-b'       | <error>  | 1.0.0-b     | 1.0.0-b
   0          | <error>  | 0.0.0       | 0.0.0
  '0-rc1'     | <error>  | 0.0.0-rc1   | 0.0.0-rc1
  '1.02_30'   | <error>  | 1.23.0      | 1.23.0
   1.02_30    | <error>  | 1.23.0      | 1.23.0

Note that, unlike in L<version>, the C<declare> and C<parse> methods ignore
underscores. That is, version strings with underscores are treated as decimal
numbers. Hence, the last two examples yield exactly the same semantic
versions.

As with L<version> objects, the comparison and stringification operators are
all overloaded, so that you can compare semantic versions. You can also
compare semantic versions with version objects (but not the other way around,
alas). Boolean operators are also overloaded, such that all semantic version
objects except for those consisting only of zeros are considered true.

=head1 Interface

=head2 Constructors

=head3 C<new>

  my $semver = SemVer->new('1.2.2');

Performs a validating parse of the version string and returns a new semantic
version object. If the version string does not adhere to the semantic version
specification an exception will be thrown. See C<declare> and C<parse> for
more forgiving constructors.

=head3 C<declare>

  my $semver = SemVer->declare('1.2'); # 1.2.0

This parser strips out any underscores from the version string and passes it
to to C<version>'s C<declare> constructor, which always creates dotted-integer
version objects. This is the most flexible way to declare versions. Consider
using it to normalize version strings.

=head3 C<parse>

  my $semver = SemVer->parse('1.2'); # 1.200.0

This parser dispatches to C<version>'s C<parse> constructor, which tries to be
more flexible in how it converts simple decimal strings and numbers. Not
really recommended, since it's treatment of decimals is quite different from
the dotted-integer format of semantic version strings, and thus can lead to
inconsistencies. Included only for proper compatibility with L<version>.

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<normal>

  SemVer->declare('v1.2')->normal;       # 1.2.0
  SemVer->parse('1.2')->normal;          # 1.200.0
  SemVer->declare('1.02.0-b1')->normal;  # 1.2.0-b1
  SemVer->parse('1.02_30')->normal       # 1.230.0
  SemVer->parse(1.02_30)->normal         # 1.23.0

Returns a normalized representation of the version. This string will always be
a strictly-valid dotted-integer semantic version string suitable for passing
to C<new()>. Unlike L<version>'s C<normal> method, there will be no leading
"v".

=head3 C<stringify>

  SemVer->declare('v1.2')->stringify;    # v1.2
  SemVer->parse('1.200')->stringify;     # v1.200
  SemVer->declare('1.2-r1')->stringify;  # v1.2-r1
  SemVer->parse(1.02_30)->stringify;     # v1.0230
  SemVer->parse(1.02_30)->stringify;     # v1.023

Returns a string that is as close to the original representation as possible.
If the original representation was a numeric literal, it will be returned the
way perl would normally represent it in a string. This method is used whenever
a version object is interpolated into a string.

=head3 C<numify>

Throws an exception. Semantic versions cannot be numified. Just don't go
there.

=head3 C<is_alpha>

  my $is_alpha = $semver->is_alpha;

Returns true if an ASCII string is appended to the end of the version string.
This also means that the version number is a "special version", in the
semantic versioning specification meaning of the phrase.

=head3 C<vcmp>

Compares the semantic version object to another version object or string and
returns 0 if they're the same, -1 if the invocant is smaller than the
argument, and 1 if the invocant is greater than the argument.

Mostly you don't need to worry about this: Just use the comparison operators
instead. They will use this method:

  if ($semver < $another_semver) {
      die "Need $another_semver or higher";
  }

Note that in addition to comparing other semantic version objects, you can
also compare regular L<version> objects:

  if ($semver < $version) {
      die "Need $version or higher";
  }

You can also pass in a version string. It will be turned into a semantic
version object using C<declare>. So if you're using integer versions, you may
or may not get what you want:

  my $semver  = version::Semver->new('1.2.0');
  my $version = '1.2';
  my $bool    = $semver == $version; # true

If that's not what you want, pass the string to C<parse> first:

  my $semver  = version::Semver->new('1.2.0');
  my $version = version::Semver->parse('1.2'); # 1.200.0
  my $bool    = $semver == $version; # false
