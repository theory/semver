SemVer version 0.10.1
=====================

[![CPAN version](https://badge.fury.io/pl/SemVer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/pl/SemVer)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/theory/semver/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/theory/semver/actions/)

This module subclasses [`version`] to create semantic versions, as defined by
the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Specification]
The salient points of the specification, for the purposes of version
formatting, are:

1. A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are 
   non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major 
   version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element 
   MUST increase numerically.
   For instance: `1.9.0 < 1.10.0 < 1.11.0`.

2. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series 
   of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. 
   Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. 
   Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading 
   zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated 
   normal version. A pre-release version indicates that the version is 
   unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements 
   as denoted by its associated normal version. 
   Examples: `1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92`.

3. Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of 
   dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release 
   version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen 
   [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata SHOULD be 
   ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ 
   only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. 
   Examples: `1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85`.

4. Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered. 
   Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, 
   patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not 
   figure into precedence). Precedence is determined by the first difference 
   when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: 
   Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically. 
   Example: `1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1`. 
   When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower 
   precedence than a normal version. 
   Example: `1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0`. 
   Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and 
   patch version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier 
   from left to right until a difference is found as follows: identifiers 
   consisting of only digits are compared numerically and identifiers with 
   letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order. Numeric 
   identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers. A 
   larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller 
   set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal. 
   Example: `1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0`.
